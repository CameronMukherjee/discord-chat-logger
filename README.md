# Presence - A Discord Chat Logger
Log all chats within your server using this bot. Great for business orientated servers and machine 
learning projects.
<br>
## Warning (Important Please Read):
It is your responsibility to notify all members of your server that message logging is enabled;
 Presence itself does not announce this.
It is against Discord TOS to log user messages without consent.

## Setup
1. Download project (via release, git or zip file).
2. Extract files to location you would like to store the bot and database.
3. Fill in the .env file with your discord bot token and database name (can be whatever you want).
4. Run the bot & invite the bot to your server.
5. Optional, give bot admin permissions, so it has access to read all text channels.
6. Use an SQLite3 database viewer to view, edit and delete messages from the database.
7. Done!
